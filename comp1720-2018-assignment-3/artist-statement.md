# Artist Statement

The arcade game that this is based on is the old NES game called duck hunt and some minor inspiration of the red pill and blue pill scene from the matrix.

What im trying to persuade to the player is the idea of consequence. If the player were to shoot a red pill, the background would changed to a darker color,but if you shoot a blue pill the background will change to a lighter color.

I wanted the game to start off with a background color thats of a neutral state (grey). Both blue and red pills will instantly start moving around the screen uncontrolably. Both pills contrast instantly with the grey so it catches the viewers attetion.
