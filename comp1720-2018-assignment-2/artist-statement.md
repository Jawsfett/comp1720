# Artist Statement

The inspiration for my design is a combination of two things. First is from the big blue button meme. Second is the "Eat me", "Drink Me" items from Alice in Wonderland. The design is a panel with a large button that prompts the user with "Press Me".

When you start the colour picker the button will continuously change colour. To select your colour just click the button when your desired colour shows and the background will change to that colour. There is no particular order of which colour will show, its random. You can't predict what colour will show next.

Dangers to this approach is one thing. If you miss your desired colour and click the button you will end up with a colour you did not desire.

I calibrated the level of challenge just enough to give the user a small but enough amount of time to react and press the button when their colour shows up.

I am trying to make the viewer feel curious when shown the button. I also want the viewer to then feel focused and determined once they realised they need to press the button at the right time to select their desired colour.
