# Artist Statement

I decided to take inspiration off the p5.js reference website and matched the theme of the website towards my name tag. 

The idea that im trying to communicate is to feel part of the learning experience throughout the course. 

What im trying to make the viewer feel is to show how the p5.js website gives a simple but bright and welcoming aesthetic. 

The concepts im trying to explore is how the white polka dots contrast with the pinkish red to pierce the viwers eyes and guide their attention towards the name between the two borders. 

Ive balanced the aspect of interestingness using the bright colours that contrast well to attract the viewer and to combine it with a leadgable name and a friendly asterix to start with.
