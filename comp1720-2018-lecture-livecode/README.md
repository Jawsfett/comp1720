# COMP1720 lecture livecoding repo

This repo contains all the things that we've livecoded together in the
**praxis** sections of the lectures.

We'll use this same repo for the whole course, and I'll add **tags** to each
week's content so you can find it easily.

If you have any questions about anything, then ask away on the forum in the
[**lectures**
subcategory](https://discourse.cecs.anu.edu.au/c/comp1720/lectures).
