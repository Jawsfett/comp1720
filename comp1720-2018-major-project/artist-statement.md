# Artist Statement

I have interpreted the theme "new" with an interactive experience of a flower growing, blooming, decaying, dying and rebirth. Showing a full cycle of life and death and reincarnation. 

I have structured the experience with a begining stage of a pre grown flower seed within a flowerpot. The user must then grow the flower and bloom it to reach the middle stage. At this middle stage the user can proceed to start making the flower start to decay losing its petals, proceeding to its end stage. At the end stage once the flower loses its petals it will die descending back down into the flower pot, this will bring us back to the beggining stage and start all over again with a new flower.

I am trying to make the viewer think that when the flower grows blooms and dies, the viewer will take it for granted and that they will think they can regrow the flower again and again. This removes any thought of loss towards the viewer due to the added feature of rebirth.

I am trying to make the viewer feel that the constant cycle of life and death is quite hard to swallow when explored on a large scale but if I were to show it on a small scale for example a flower, it would be easier to help the viewer understand.

what do you hope the viewer tells their friends about your artwork after they leave the gallery?
What I hope the viewer tells others about my artwork is how it could give some or if not, minor insight towards the idea of their behaviours towards certain interactions and distinguish the difference between one that risks loss and one that does not.
