# Interaction Statement

At the start of this interactive experience, you will be greeted with a flower pot with a un-bloomed seed in it with a yellow background.
From here you will need the seed to grow and bloom. To do this you click anywhere on the screen and hold. This will prompt the seed to grow.
While the seed grows it will start to bloom petals and grow a stem. 
Do this until the seed has fully grown into a bright flower with petals spinning around the centre.
You may now click the centre of the flower which will cause the flower to lose a petal. When all petals are gone the flower will grow back into the flowerpot and become a seed once again. 
Repeat the process and the flower will have a new color of petals every time.
Sometimes flowers are unable to grow fully due to circumstantual reasons so in this experience you may attempt to grow the flower and remove its petals before it blooms which will cause the flower to behave how as it would normally lose its petals.
