    scale(s);
    for(var i=0; i<j; i+=30){
        push();
        rotate(radians(i+millis()/100));

        ellipse(0, 0-b1/2-50, 60, b3);
        pop();
        }
        fill(248, 249, 167);
        ellipse(0, 0, 130, 130);
        pop();
  - comment: code has been heavily modified to serve my liking but its foundations are provided from the link.

code:
  var colors = ['#FFFFFF', '#808080', '#000000', '#FF0000', '#800000', '#FFFF00', '#808000', '#00FF00', '#008000', '#00FFFF', '#008080', '#0000FF', '#000080', '#FF00FF','#ffc0cb', '#800080'];
  var colorSwap = 0;
  colorSwap = colors[int(random(0, colors.length))];
    - comment: These lines of code are from the color picker assignment inorder to help me with a minor feature within my major project.
